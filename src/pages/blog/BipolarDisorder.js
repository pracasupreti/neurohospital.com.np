            Extreme mood swings or episodes of mania and depression are
            hallmarks of bipolar disorder, formerly known as manic-depressive
            illness. Periods of extreme energy, high mood, and impulsive
            behavior — known as mania — can alternate with depressive and manic
            episodes of profound sadness and hopelessness.

            Manic-depressive illness, now more commonly known as bipolar
            disorder, is a mental health condition characterized by extreme mood
            swings or episodes of mania and depression.
          </p>
          <p>
            The term “manic-depressive illness” was historically used to
            describe the disorder and highlights the two main phases of the
            condition: manic episodes and depressive episodes.

            A person’s everyday life, relationships, and general functioning can
            all be greatly impacted by these mood episodes, which can linger for
            weeks or months.

          <p>There are three main types of bipolar disorder:</p>

            {" "}
            The exact cause of bipolar disorder is not fully understood, but it
            is likely to involve a combination of genetic, biological, and
            environmental factors. Treatment typically involves a combination of
            medication, such as mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and
            antidepressants, as well as psychotherapy and lifestyle changes.
          </p>

            <li>
              <b>Bipolar I Disorder</b>
              <br />
              This is characterized by manic episodes that last at least seven
              days or by manic symptoms that are severe enough to require
              immediate hospitalization. Depressive episodes typically occur as
              well, lasting for at least two weeks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Bipolar II Disorder</b>
              <br />
              In this type, individuals experience both depressive and hypomanic
              episodes. Hypomanic episodes are less severe than full-blown manic
              episodes and do not typically lead to significant impairment.
              Depressive episodes are often more frequent and can be more
              prolonged.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Cyclothymic Disorder</b>
              <br />
              This is a milder form of bipolar disorder characterized by
              episodes of hypomania and mild depression that last for at least
              two years (one year in children and adolescents). However, the
              symptoms do not meet the criteria for full-blown manic or
              depressive episodes.

            If you are concerned that you or someone you know may have bipolar
            disorder, it is important to seek professional help from a mental
            health professional. Early diagnosis and treatment can make a
            significant difference in managing the symptoms and improving
            quality of life.
