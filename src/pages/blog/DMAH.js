          <p className="blog-heading">What is a Migraine?</p>
          <p>
            A migraine is a specific type of headache disorder characterized by
            recurrent, moderate to severe throbbing pain, often on one side of
            the head. Migraines are usually accompanied by other symptoms, such
            as nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light (photophobia), and sound
            (phonophobia). Some individuals experience aura—a series of sensory
            disturbances—before the onset of a migraine.

            Difference between migraine-and-headache:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Severity of Pain:</b>Migraines typically involve intense,
              throbbing pain that can significantly impact daily activities.
              Headaches, on the other hand, can range from mild discomfort to
              moderate pain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Associated Symptoms:</b>Migraines are often accompanied by
              symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and
              sound, which are less common in regular headaches.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Duration:</b>
              Migraines generally last longer than typical headaches, often
              lasting from a few hours to several days. Headaches may be more
              short-lived, depending on the type and cause.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Triggers and Causes:</b>Migraines often have specific triggers,
              such as hormonal changes, stress, certain foods, or environmental
              factors. Headaches may be triggered by factors like dehydration,
              muscle tension, or sinus congestion.
