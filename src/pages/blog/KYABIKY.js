            <li>
              <b>Diagnosis and Evaluation:</b>
              <br />
              Your doctor will perform a physical exam and may order tests such
              as blood tests, urine tests, and imaging studies like ultrasound
              or CT scan to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Surgical Intervention:</b>
              <br />
              The most common treatment for appendicitis is surgery to remove
              the inflamed appendix, known as an appendectomy. In most cases,
              surgery is performed as soon as possible to prevent the appendix
              from rupturing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Recovery and Follow-Up:</b>
              <br />
              After surgery, you'll need some time to recover. Most people can
              leave the hospital within a day or two after surgery and resume
              normal activities within a few weeks. Follow your doctor's
              instructions for post-operative care and attend follow-up
              appointments to ensure a smooth recovery.

            prompt medical attention, you can prevent these complications and
            ensure a speedy recovery.
