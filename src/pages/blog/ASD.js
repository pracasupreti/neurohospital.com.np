              male-to-female ratio of 4:1 . The{" "}
              <u>Autism Care Society of Nepal</u>&nbsp; states that around 2.5
              to 3.5 lakh persons are living with autism in Nepal, and among
              them, 60,000 to 90,000 are severely affected. It is a genetic
              disorder that is associated with increasing parental age and an
              increased risk of occurrence in that parent group.

              Symptoms start to develop in early infancy; some develop well till
              9–12 months, and others till 15–18 months, and then the symptoms
              start. First and foremost, there is a deficit in social
              communication and social interaction.

                A child with autism has impaired sharing of interest and

              pro-declarative pointing (pointing of objects for the purpose of
              getting that object). Children with this disorder do not use
              social gestures like NAMASTE and BYE-BYE appropriately.

              There is no normal back-and-forth conversation, along with poor
              integration of verbal and non-verbal communication. There is an
              abnormality in eye contact and gaze avoidance (when a person looks
              into their eyes, they look the other way). Children often have
              reduced expressions of emotion like fear, sadness, etc.

              They also do not point at the object with an index finger, and
              speech is usually delayed. They find it difficult to make friends
              and also are not able to do imaginative play (feeding a doll,
              making her sleep, copying her mother, pretending to talk on the
              phone)
            </p>
            <p>
              Children also find it difficult to adjust their behavior to suit
              the social context. Children with autism also have restricted,
              repeated patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. Repeated
              motor movement, speech, and use of objects are seen in children
              suffering from this disorder.

              the whole day playing with a piece of toy, paper, pen/collect coin

            <p>
              The main aim is to start the treatment as soon as a diagnosis is
              made. Early diagnosis and early intervention in autism (ASD) give
              the best outcome
            </p>
            <p>Here are some common approaches to autism treatment:</p>
            <p className="blog-heading">Behavioral Therapies:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA):</b>
                ABA is a widely used therapeutic approach that focuses on
                reinforcing positive behaviors and minimizing undesirable ones.
                It is often used to teach new skills and improve social
                behaviors.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):</b>
                CBT helps individuals with autism manage anxiety, improve social
                skills, and cope with challenging situations by identifying and
                changing negative thought patterns.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Social Skills Training:</b>This type of therapy focuses on
                improving communication and social interaction skills, helping
                individuals navigate social situations more effectively.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div className="blog-heading">Educational Interventions:</div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Special Education Services:</b>
                Tailored educational programs and classroom accommodations can
                help individuals with autism thrive academically. This may
                include individualized education plans (IEPs) or 504 plans.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Speech and Language Therapy:</b>
                Many individuals with autism experience challenges in
                communication. Speech and language therapy can help improve
                communication skills, including spoken language and non-verbal
                communication.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="blog-heading">Medication:</p>
            <p>
              Medications may be prescribed to manage specific symptoms or
              co-occurring conditions, such as anxiety, depression, or
              attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It’s important to
              consult with a healthcare professional to discuss the potential
              benefits and risks of medication.
            </p>
            <p className="blog-heading">Occupational Therapy:</p>
            <p>
              Occupational therapists can help individuals with autism develop
              skills for daily living, improve motor skills, and address sensory
              sensitivities.
            </p>
            <p className="blog-heading">Sensory Integration Therapy:</p>
            <p>
              This therapy aims to help individuals manage sensory sensitivities
              or sensory-seeking behaviors by exposing them to various sensory
              experiences in a controlled and gradual manner.
            </p>
            <p className="blog-heading">Parent and Family Involvement:</p>
            <p>
              Involving parents and families in the therapeutic process is
              essential. Training and support can help caregivers understand and
              implement strategies to support their child’s development.
            </p>
            <p className="blog-heading">
              Alternative and Complementary Therapies:
            </p>
            <p>
              Some individuals with autism may benefit from alternative
              therapies such as music therapy, art therapy, or animal-assisted
              therapy.
            </p>
            <p>
              While these approaches may offer benefits, it’s important to
              ensure they are evidence-based and complement traditional
              interventions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine use of
              ASD-specific screening tools at 18 and 24 months of age. The
              modified checklist for autism (MCHAT) is the most widely used
              screening tool.
            </p>
            <p>
              So far, there is no biological test for ASD, and the diagnosis is
              based on a group of clinical features.

              Early intervention Therapy is the mainstay of treatment, in which
              applied behavior analysis (ABA) is most evidence-based and
              practiced. Therapy should address the issues of communication,
              socialization and adaptive behavior, and it should be
              individualized and done on a daily basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              Parental training and involvement are very important. Currently,
              there is no drug to cure the care deficit of social interaction
              and communication.
            </p>
            <p>
              Drugs are used to manage the symptoms associated with maladaptive
              behaviors, repetitive movements, and sleep problems. With early
              intervention therapy, there is a significant improvement in
              socialization and communication skills.

              10% of children can outgrow their condition. A child with good
              intelligence, early language development, early diagnosis, early
              intensive behavior therapy, and management with applied behavior
              analysis has good outcomes. Socio-economic factors also play an
              important role in good outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The life expectancy of ASD children is 3 years less than that of
              the general population.

            <p className="blog-heading">Conclusion</p>
            <p>
              Autism is a complex neuro-behavioral disorder that includes social
              impairment in social interaction, language development, and
              commutation skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              Along with this, children have rigid and repetitive behavior. This
              disorder covers a large spectrum of symptoms and different levels
              of impairment, that may limit a child’s ability to live a normal
              life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Early diagnosis and early intervention may lead a child to live a
              better quality of life. So, increasing awareness about the
              condition is very important for the general population to outgrow
              the taboo and false beliefs that exist in society.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before starting any treatment, it’s crucial to consult with
              healthcare professionals, including pediatricians, psychologists,
              and developmental specialists, to create a personalized treatment
              plan tailored to the individual’s unique needs and challenges.
              Additionally, staying informed about the latest research and
              evidence-based practices is essential in providing the most
              effective support for individuals with autism.
