            A phobia is an uncontrollable, irrational, and lasting fear of a
            certain object, situation, or activity. This fear can be so
            overwhelming that a person may go to great lengths to avoid the
            source of this fear. One response can be a panic attack. This is a
            sudden, intense fear that lasts for several minutes. It happens when
            there is no real danger.
