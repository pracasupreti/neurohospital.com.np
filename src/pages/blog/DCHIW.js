          <p>
            Winter skin care can be particularly difficult, especially on the
            hands and other regions of the body that are frequently exposed to
            cold air. The skin’s protective layer is susceptible to damage from
            the extreme cold of wintertime as well as from repeated exposure to
            hot, forceful heating sources like fire and heaters. One
            contributing element to the current post-COVID period may be the
            regular usage of hand sanitizers and antiseptic handwashes.
          </p>
          <p>
            When appropriate care is not done to restore the barrier and
            moisture, the skin can be severely impacted by dry, chapped, flaky
            skin, even in little cuts such as wounds that are bleeding and
            painful. A weaker skin barrier makes older people and children more
            vulnerable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many times, these issues are resolved by the person herself or
            himself using OTC creams containing urea, glycerin,glycolic acid,
            paraffin, etc. But occasionally it warrants a visit to a
            dermatologist when it is recalcitrant to any of these agents. These
            could be due to the exacerbation of eczema or psoriasis in winter,
            which is itchy, and morphology can really be deceiving as it
            simulates very dry, flaky, chapped skin.

            Tips to treat or prevent chapped hands:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Try to choose alcohol-based sanitizers, as they are less drying.
            </li>
            <li>Avoid using the air-dry system to dry hands after washing.</li>
            <li>Apply thick creams after washing your hands.</li>
            <li>
              Sometimes we need to opt for wrap therapy after applying
              moisturizer to seal the cracked skin.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Whatever the cause, the first line of defense is to moisturize,
            moisturize, and moisturize. It’s the moisturizer applied directly to
            the skin that will keep water from evaporating.

          <p>Chapped Hand</p>

          <p>
            Avoid exposure to cold air by using warm woolen gloves or mittens;
            avoid direct heating systems or the use of humidifiers. Avoid direct
            use of detergents; use gloves. If the condition still doesn’t
            improve, you should consider visiting a dermatologist to recognize
            the culprit.

            Dry and chapped hands can be a common problem, especially during
            cold weather or when exposed to harsh conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are some tips to help alleviate and prevent dry, chapped hands:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Moisturize regularly:</b>
              <br />
              Use a good quality, fragrance-free hand cream or moisturizer.
              <br />
              Apply moisturizer immediately after washing your hands, and carry
              a small bottle with you to reapply throughout the day.
              <br />
              Consider using a thick ointment or petroleum jelly at night for
              intense hydration.Mild to moderate pain that feels like a tight
              band around the head.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b> Choose the right soap:</b>
              <br />
              Use a mild, moisturizing soap when washing your hands.
              <br />
              Avoid harsh, antibacterial soaps, as they can strip your skin of
              natural oils.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Protect your hands:</b>
              <br />
              Wear gloves when doing household chores, especially if you are
              using cleaning agents or washing dishes.
              <br />
              Wear gloves in cold weather to protect your hands from harsh winds
              and low temperatures.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Avoid hot water:</b> <br />
              Hot water can strip your skin of its natural oils. Wash your hands
              with lukewarm water instead.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b> Exfoliate occasionally:</b>
              <br />
              Use a gentle exfoliating scrub to remove dead skin cells. This can
              help your moisturizer penetrate better.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b> Stay hydrated:</b>
              <br />
              Drink plenty of water to keep your skin hydrated from the inside
              out.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Humidify your environment: </b>
              <br />
              If you live in a dry climate or use heating during the winter,
              consider using a humidifier to add moisture to the air.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Protect your hands from the sun: </b>
              <br />
              Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen to your hands if you’ll be
              spending time in the sun.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b> Avoid irritants:</b>
              <br />
              Limit exposure to harsh chemicals and irritants. If you must use
              them, wear protective gloves.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b> Consult a dermatologist:</b>
              <br />
              If your dry, chapped hands persist or worsen despite home care,
              consult a dermatologist for personalized advice and possible
              prescription treatments.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Remember that consistent care is key to maintaining healthy skin. If
            you have any concerns about your skin condition, it’s always a good
            idea to seek professional advice.
