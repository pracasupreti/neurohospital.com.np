            Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)

          <p>
            Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal condition that
            affects women of reproductive age. It affects an estimated 8–13% of
            reproductive-aged women among which 70% of affected women remain
            undiagnosed worldwide. Stein and Leventhal reported the classic
            symptomatology in 1935.
          </p>
          <p>
            They described a group of women with amenorrhea, infertility,
            hirsutism, and enlarged polycystic ovaries. The authors found that,
            after ovarian biopsy, the women began to menstruate regularly.
          </p>
          <p>
            PCOS can cause hormonal imbalances, irregular periods, excess
            androgen levels, and cysts in the ovaries. Irregular periods,
            usually with a lack of ovulation, can make it difficult to become
            pregnant. PCOS is a leading cause of infertility worldwide.

              absent periods.

            <li>Acne or oily skin.</li>

            </li>
            <li>
              Metabolic Syndrome: Central obesity (weight gain, especially
              around the belly), insulin resistance.

          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Lifestyle changes:</b>
              <br />
              Management of lifestyle habits should be the first-line therapy
              for all women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and the target
              should be weight loss (5–10 %) in women with a body mass index
              (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2 and prevention of weight gain in women with a BMI
              18.5–24.9 kg/m2. The program should include both reduced dietary
              energy intake and regular exercise.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Oral Contraceptive Pill (OCP):</b> <br />
              To regulate the menstrual cycle by medication to treat hormonal
              imbalance and insulin resistance
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Cyclic Progestogens:</b>
              <br />
              They should be used when contraception is not required and there
              are no signs of hyperandrogenism. Dydrogesterone and
              Medroxyprogesterone Acetate is usually used for 10–14 days every
              two to three months.
