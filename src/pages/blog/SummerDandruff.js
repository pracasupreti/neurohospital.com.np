          <p>
            Summer dandruff is a common condition that causes the skin on the
            scalp to flake. It isn’t contagious or serious. But it can be
            embarrassing and difficult to treat. Summer means excessive
            sweating, which creates the perfect environment for the microbe to
            cause a dandruff flare-up.
          </p>
          <p className="blog-heading">Overview</p>
          <p>
            Dandruff is a mild form of seborrheic dermatitis. Mild dandruff can
            be treated with a gentle daily shampoo. If that doesn’t work, a
            medicated shampoo may help.

          <p className="blog-heading">Causes of dandruff in summer</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Sweat:</b>
              <br />
              Everyone sweats during the summer which is completely normal. It
              is one of the main causes of dandruff in summer. Whether you’re
              travelling, working out, or simply spending the day by the beach,
              your scalp is bound to sweat and that can attract dandruff causing
              bacteria.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Humidity:</b>
              <br />
              Effects of Heat and Humidity on your Hair allows sweat to
              evaporate less effectively, and sweat can trap bacteria, excess
              oil, dirt, and pollutants. These can quickly build up on your
              scalp and weaken the scalp barrier. This is also why hot and humid
              seasons is also the time when you might get dandruff.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b> Pollution:</b>
              <br />
              Air pollution can cause dandruff as the pollution that the air is
              circulating causes allergic reactions, skin conditions,
              irritation, and inflammation. When these elements are present, you
              will see signs of dandruff as your scalp develops bumps and
              eventually sheds the dead skin.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b> Over-washing your hair:</b>
              <br />
              If you’re trying to get rid of the sweat so that you don’t develop
              dandruff, you will probably consider washing your hair a lot more
              often. Even if it is just because you want to feel fresh and so
              you increase the number of times you wash your hair, it can lead
              to dandruff as well. Over-washing the hair can lead to excessive
              friction, excessive dryness, and eventually lead to dandruff.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Lifestyle and stress:</b>
              <br />
              Our lifestyle during the summer months has a large impact on how
              our scalp behaves. Heat-stress and discomfort might cause a spike
              in our stress hormones that can disrupt our oil production.
              Exercising during the summer months also leads to an increase in
              the body temperature, which can further increase sweating. All
              these factors are important to consider when we think about the
              reasons for dandruff in summer.

          <p className="blog-heading">Good hair hygiene:</p>
          <p>
            Wash your hair at least three times a week. This is particularly
            important during the hot summer months when the oil secretion from
            the scalp is high. This oil traps the dirt and sweat, making
            dandruff worse.

          <p className="blog-heading">Do not touch your scalp:</p>
          <p>
            Although dandruff makes the scalp itchy, the practice of scratching
            the scalp can introduce more infection and dirt to the scalp, making
            dandruff worse.
          </p>
          <p className="blog-heading">Do not overuse hair styling products:</p>
          <p>
            Using too many different hair styling products can make the scalp
            dry, leading to dandruff.
          </p>
          <p className="blog-heading">Use the right shampoo:</p>
          <p>
            The role of the shampoo is to remove the oil and dirt from the
            scalp. It must not irritate the scalp skin.
          </p>
          <p className="blog-heading">Keep stress levels low:</p>
          <p>
            Although stress does not cause dandruff, it compromises the immune
            system which leads to the worsening of dandruff. So, adopt practices
            that reduce stress.
          </p>
          <p className="blog-heading">Avoid overhead sun rays:</p>
          <p>
            Avoid venturing out when the sun’s rays are overhead. Also, prefer
            going out in fresh air as it helps reduce the oil buildup on the
            scalp.

            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              Use a dry shampoo occasionally, which can absorb sweat and keep

              hair.

              Aloe Vera gel can act as a coolant for your scalp, allowing its
