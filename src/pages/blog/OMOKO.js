          <p>
            Osteoarthritis &#123;OA&#125;&nbsp;is a leading cause of disability
            worldwide. As a major weight-bearing joint, the knee is one of the
            most common sites affected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Knee osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease of the knee joint that
            causes progressive loss of articular cartilage. Osteoarthritis of
            the knee happens when cartilage of the knee joint breaks down.
          </p>
          <p>
            When this happens, the bones in your knee joint rub together,
            causing friction that makes your knees hurt, becoming stiff or
            swollen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Osteoarthritis in the Knee can’t be cured but there are treatments
            that can relieve symptoms and slow down the progress.

            joint might be painful at rest or during night which may lead to
            decreased walking distance.
          </p>

            Other symptoms are that the knee feels stiff, particularly when you
            first get up or when you have been sitting for a long time. Your
            knee looks swollen or feels puffy. You hear a cracking noise when
            you move your knee.

            Management and treatment options for knee osteoarthritis may
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Lifestyle Modifications:</b>
              Weight management, regular exercise, and avoiding activities that
              exacerbate knee pain can help manage symptoms.

            <li>
              <b> Physical Therapy:</b>
              Targeted exercises and physical therapy can improve joint function
              and strengthen surrounding muscles.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b> Medications:</b>
              Pain relievers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and
              corticosteroid injections may be prescribed to manage pain and
              inflammation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b> Assistive Devices:</b>
              Braces, orthotic shoe inserts, or canes may be recommended to
              provide support and reduce stress on the knee joint.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Injections:</b> Hyaluronic acid injections or platelet-rich
              plasma (PRP) injections may be considered to provide relief and
              improve joint lubrication.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Surgical Options:</b> In severe cases, when conservative
              measures are insufficient, surgical interventions such as
              arthroscopy, osteotomy, or joint replacement (total knee
              replacement) may be recommended.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="blog-heading">Treatment</p>

          <p>
            The treatment of knee osteoarthritis typically involves a
            combination of lifestyle modifications, non-pharmacological
            interventions, medications, and, in some cases, surgical options.
          </p>
          <p>
            The specific approach may vary based on the severity of symptoms,
            the individual’s overall health, and the preferences of both the
            patient and healthcare provider.
          </p>
          <p className="blog-heading">Conclusion</p>
          <p>
            Osteoarthritis of the Knee is a common disease that causes
            significant disability. Most patients can be managed conservatively
            in the outpatient setting.
          </p>
          <p>
            A small minority of cases require surgery. The Cornerstones of
            treatment are weight loss, physical therapy and Analgesia. Walking
            aids or orthoses are useful management and early consultation with
            an Orthopedic Surgeon should be made.
