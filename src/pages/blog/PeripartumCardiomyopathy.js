          <p>
            Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a form of acute and sometimes
            severe cardiac degeneration that leads to clinical heart failure
            during pregnancy or in the early postpartum period. The disorder is
            generally defined as maternal heart failure with systolic
            dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction, &lt; 45%) that
            develops in the last month of pregnancy or in the first 5 months
            after delivery, in the absence of known pre-existing cardiac
            dysfunction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Peripartum cardiomyopathy complicates approximately 1 in 2000 births
            worldwide, with substantial variation among regions.PPCM is more
            common in women older than 30 years, black women, multiparous women,
            women with preeclampsia or hypertension, and those who smoke or are
            malnourished.
          </p>
          <p>
            Peripartum cardiomyopathy is now a leading cause of maternal death
            around the world. Approximately 60% of cases of cardiogenic shock
            during pregnancy or in the early postpartum period are caused by
            peripartum cardiomyopathy. Although cardiac function typically
            recovers in more than 50% of affected patients, morbidity and
            mortality are nevertheless high, with some patients requiring a left
            ventricular assist device (LVAD) or cardiac transplantation.
          </p>
          <p className="blog-heading">Clinical Presentation</p>
          <p>
            Women with PPCM most commonly present in the last month of pregnancy
            or in the first five months postpartum with symptoms of dyspnea on
            exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, edema of the
            lower extremities, fatigue, chest pain and cough. A few patients may
            also present in cardiogenic shock. A minority of patients present
            with severe arrhythmias. Physical examination may reveal pulmonary
            rales, raised jugular venous pressure, peripheral edema, tachypnea,
            and tachycardia with irregular peripheral pulses, displaced apical
            impulse, or murmurs of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.

          <p className="blog-heading">Diagnosis</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              12-lead electrocardiogram — Identifying associated arrhythmias
            </li>
            <li>
              Echocardiography- to confirm the diagnosis, to assess associated
              cardiac conditions and their severity
            </li>
            <li>Cardiac Biomarkers-for ruling out heart failure</li>
            <li>
              MRI-can accurately assess cardiac chamber volume and systolic
              function and is more sensitive in identifying intracardiac
              thrombus than echocardiography.
            </li>
            <li>
              Endomyocardial Biopsy- is rarely performed to exclude other causes
              of LV dysfunction, particularly when there is diagnostic
              uncertainty.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="blog-heading">Etiology</p>
          <p>
            There is evidence that various mechanisms may be responsible for
            PPCM, including hemodynamic stresses of pregnancy, vasculo-hormonal
            factors, inflammation, immunology and genetics. These remain
            plausible etiologies, but none of them is definitive since PPCM is
            primarily considered an idiopathic myocardial disease of pregnancy.

          <p className="blog-heading">Management</p>
          <p>Acute heart failure during pregnancy</p>
          <p>
            Rapid diagnosis and decision-making are essential for all pregnant
            women with acute heart failure, as are a management algorithm and
            establishment of a multidisciplinary team that includes
            cardiologists, intensivists, obstetric physicians, neonatologists,
            anesthesiologists, and cardiac surgeons.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, the welfare of the fetus must be considered while
            implementing diagnostic tests and treatment during pregnancy.
            Therapeutic recommendations for mild, moderate, and severe forms of
            heart failure are listed under the BOARD therapeutic scheme (like
            Bromocriptine, Oral heart failure therapy, Anticoagulation,
            Vaso-relaxing agents, and Diuretics)
          </p>
          <p>
            Women with severe forms of heart failure will require intensive care
            management, with invasive monitoring including intra-arterial blood
            pressure, central venous pressure, and a pulmonary artery catheter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Women presenting with shock will require inotropic and vasopressor
            support. Patients refractory to medical management may require
            short-term assist devices in the form of extracorporeal membrane
            oxygenation or long-term devices such as a ventricular assist device
            (VAD).
          </p>
          <p className="blog-heading">Cardiac Transplantation</p>
          <p>
            In the worst-case scenario, if all possible conservative therapeutic
            options fail, heart transplantation is the last treatment choice.
          </p>
          <p className="blog-heading">Delivery</p>
          <p>
            Unless PPCM threatens the life of mother or fetus, there is no
            indication for early delivery, but onset of hemodynamic instability
            requires urgent delivery irrespective of gestation period.
          </p>
          <p>
            A planned Cesarean section with appropriate inotropic/vasopressor
            and/or mechanical support is preferred in decompensated or very
            severe heart failure, while induction of labor may be possible in
            most asymptomatic women with less severe heart failure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Epidural analgesia is recommended during labor as it will stabilize
            cardiac output, while combined spinal and epidural anesthesia is
            preferred for Cesarean sections.
          </p>
          <p className="blog-heading">Breastfeeding</p>
          <p>
            In most women with stable PPCM, breastfeeding can be supported.
            However, in women with severe heart failure, the high metabolic
            demands of lactation and breastfeeding require consideration of
            prevention of lactation.
          </p>
          <p className="blog-heading">Counseling and subsequent pregnancies</p>
          <p>
            Women are recommended to undergo six-monthly echocardiography until
            Left ventricular ejection fraction recovers to &gt; 50% and annual
            visits for 10 years for women who remain stable after tapering of
            drug therapy for heart failure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Echocardiographic findings of persistent LV dilatation or reduced
            myocardial strain may be present in some patients despite normal LV
            function. In such patients life-long heart failure therapy should be
            continued.
          </p>
          <p>
            Heart failure symptoms are more frequent in women whose LVEF had not
            normalized before a subsequent pregnancy. Therefore, all patients
            with persistent LV dysfunction should be advised against future
            pregnancies.
          </p>
          <p>
            All patients with previously diagnosed PPCM and their partners
            should receive careful counseling concerning the longer-term
            prognosis and undergo risk stratification if further pregnancies are
            considered.
          </p>
          <p className="blog-heading">Conclusion</p>
          <p>
            PPCM remains an underdiagnosed peripartum disease due to its rarity.
            Women with symptoms consistent with heart failure should undergo
            clinical examination and cardiac biomarker testing, and
            echocardiography should be considered. Heart failure should be
            managed according to current guidelines, respecting the safety
            limitations during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is some evidence that bromocriptine might be helpful; a
            definitive trial is currently underway in the USA. Supportive
            therapy for heart failure should be initiated promptly and patient
            monitoring should be continued even after recovery of LV function.
          </p>
          <p>
            Women with PPCM or who experienced PPCM in a previous pregnancy
            should be managed by an experienced multidisciplinary pregnancy
            heart team. This should include careful pre-pregnancy reassessment
            and counseling.
