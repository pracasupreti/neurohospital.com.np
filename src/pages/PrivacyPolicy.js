            Hospitals have a legal and ethical obligation to protect the privacy
            of their patients' medical information. This information is highly
            sensitive and can be used for a variety of purposes, including
            making decisions about insurance coverage, employment, and housing.
            Most hospitals have a privacy policy in place that outlines how they
            collect, use, and share patient information. This policy should be
            available to patients upon request.

            Here are some of the key points that are typically included in a

              information, medical history, and treatment plans.

              Hospitals use patient information to provide care, bill for
              services, and conduct research. They may also share information

              government agencies.

              Hospitals typically only allow employees who need to know the

              Hospitals typically have security measures in place to protect
              patient information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

              physical security.

            the privacy of health information. These rights include the right to
            access their medical records, the right to request that their
            information be corrected, and the right to limit how their
            information is used and shared.

            Patients should review their hospital's privacy policy to understand

            They should also ask questions if they have any concerns about their
            privacy.
